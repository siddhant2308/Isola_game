# Isola_game
My first attempt to write java code to play a simple game. (weak attempt at AI coding). Mainly with the intention to look for help. I can look it up on google, but rather than looking for a solution i would rather prefer people pointing me to the right solution and dropping of hints rather than just giving the solutions. Also i made this so as to get familiar with github, this being my first "Repoisitory"(sorry if i spelled that wrong).

Umm so for those who dont know how the game works:(copied from https://www.hackerearth.com/problem/multiplayer/isola/description/
this is the [roblem i am attempting)
Isola is a two-player board game. It is played on a 7x7 grid which is initially filled with squares on each cell. Both players have one piece; it is in the middle position of the row closest to his/her side of the board. Players can place their piece on squares only. 

 

A move consists of two subsequent actions: 

1. Moving one's piece to a neighboring (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) position that contains a square but not the opponent's piece. 
2. Removing any square with no piece on it. 

The player who cannot move his/her piece loses the game. 

Now you are going to write code to play Isola with others or computer bot. The program you submit will run for each move played by your player in the game. 

I dont wanna say how the input will be given so that the suggestions i get are more general, rather than just aimed at solving the problem.


Thannk you anyone for going through this or taking time out to help me. If there is anything i am doing wormng or in any way not following the github community norms, kindly let me know thank you.
